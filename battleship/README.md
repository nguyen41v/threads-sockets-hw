A multi-room battleship game.
Clients connect to the server and pick their name and room.

Submitted Battleship, Client, Connect, EchoClient, and EchoServer  
Might have changed Client a bit since I made BasicClient and BasicServer after submission
(BasicClient and BasicServer are friendlier to more connections - can connect to BasicServer with any kind of basic client code)
